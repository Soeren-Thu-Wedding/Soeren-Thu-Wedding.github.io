    We know it's already enough of a time and money investment even to get
    to the wedding party. As such, we will be pleased by your very presence.
    If you still feel moved to give a gift, please keep in mind that we live on
    the other side of the world, which means a virtual or
    monetary gift is much easier than a physical gift.
