        This is a paperless wedding. That means all of invitations
        and thank-you notes are being delivered digitally. These
        small choices have helped us to enjoy a more eco-friendly wedding and
        save the trees. Thank you for your support and understanding!

        Søren and Thu are blessed enough with each other and all of their wonderful family and friends. If you still feel moved to give a gift, please keep in mind that we live on the other side of the world, which means a virtual or monetary gift is much easier than a physical gift.
